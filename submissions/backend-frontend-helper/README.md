## How to use
To install dependencies:

```

or build to the exe file by:
```bash
bun run build # file come in the "build" dir
```

note: you can rename the builded file if you want and then put that in the `PATH` in win or mac or linux
*bun.js runtime needed

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.4. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Importance
- This cli tool depends on the [Components Repository](https://github.com/code-ga/helper-cli-tool-repository) so they need the internet to run

- If you have the good component feeling free to pr into the repository and i will merge that btw
